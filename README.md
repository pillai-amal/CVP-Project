### this is done as part of the course Computational Visual Perception at FAU Erlangen
----
- The study on was done on how human perception works on draped objects. 
- 3D Objects were downloaded and Blender was used to make make cloth simulation in drapping the objects. 
- After the simulation, the the cloth and objects are exported as 512x512 grayscale images. 
- The cloth after simulation are vertex colored and part of touching the object and not toching the object with increasing intensity of whiteness. 
- The cloth without the vertex color is used for traning a 'U net' to regress the pixel distance.
