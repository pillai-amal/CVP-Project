## switch the branch -> devscartch 

### go to /datasets/script.py

It implements (some what):
- Importing-centering-scaling of the object
- Cloth sim (cannot see )
- Save both the object and imported meshes
=======
- Completed sim 
- Completed the sperate object and cloth exports 

TO DO:
- Get the Dataset
- Make the script for all object 

Issues:
- [Minor] Change the naming convections
- [Major] The cloth appears to be unsatable
